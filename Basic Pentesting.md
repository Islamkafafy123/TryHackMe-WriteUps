#  First The Recon Using Nmap And Dirbuster 
### -Nmap Using Command " nmap -sV -n -v -Pn -p- -T4"
### -gives Intersting Result 
ports 445,80,22,139,8080 are open
## Using Dirbuster gives A directory Called "/devolpment"
-Opned The Dev Directory then Found 2 files One K tell J to Change PAssword bec he cracked his Hash and one i guess is irellevent
### now Back To The machine itself
we Found Smb Port Open So we Used "enum4linux"
The machine  questions asked to bruteforce the username and password so lets use hydra
and we know that ssh is open from nmap so lets try to brute force
also enum4linux gave us 2 usernames which is jay and kay so thats astep forward
#
#### -so hydra gave us "armando" as password for jan

#  First The Recon Using Nmap And Dirbuster 
### -Nmap Using Command " nmap -sV -n -v -Pn -p- -T4"
### -gives Intersting Result 
ports 445,80,22,139,8080 are open
## Using Dirbuster gives A directory Called "/devolpment"
-Opned The Dev Directory then Found 2 files One K tell J to Change PAssword bec he cracked his Hash and one i guess is irellevent
### now Back To The machine itself
we Found Smb Port Open So we Used "enum4linux"
The machine  questions asked to bruteforce the username and password so lets use hydra
and we know that ssh is open from nmap so lets try to brute force
also enum4linux gave us 2 usernames which is jay and kay so thats astep forward
#
#### -so hydra gave us "armando" as password for jan
now we ssh and use scp to move linpeas to the machine
-- scp /root/Desktop/linpeas.sh jan@10.10.64.13:/dev/shm
rununing linpeas after chmod +x linpeas.sh
gave us that kay has privatekey shh "id_RSA"
we copied and ssh to kay
# 
tells that key is unprotected so we chmod 600 kaysshkey
so when we ssh to kay with the key it asks for passphrase

now comes John the ripper with ssh2john
we " /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py kayssh > fromjohn.txt "
#### then use johntheripper itself with rockyoutext to crack the password
-" john fromjohn.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt "
gave us the passphrase for kay
we login to kay we find the pass.bak we are looknig for
